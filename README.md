# weather_API
Weather App as a project for Free Code Camp

Uses api.openweathermap.org for weather data.
Uses ip-api.com for location data.
  I refrained from using browser geolocation data as I couldnt work out how to bypass user having to give permission.

Features I'd like to add when I have time:
  Ability to search by city, not just current location
  Display log of temperature over last 3 days
